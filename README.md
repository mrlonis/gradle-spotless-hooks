# üßº‚òïü™ù gradle-spotless-hooks

These hooks are Git-native and IDE-agnostic. You do not need to configure anything inside IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code.

## üöÄ Quickstart

This repository should be added to another repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Assuming you have `spotless` already set up in your project, you can add this repository as a submodule and manually install the hooks by running the following command in the root of your project:

```sh
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/mrlonis/gradle-spotless-hooks.git .hooks/

# Install the hooks
# If on Mac or Linux
./.hooks/install-hooks.sh
# If on Windows
.\.hooks\install-hooks.ps1

git commit -m "Adding gradle-spotless-hooks"
```

This will add the `gradle-spotless-hooks` repository as a `submodule` in the `.hooks` folder within `your project`, and install the `pre-commit` and `post-commit` hooks into the `.git/hooks/` directory. This will allow you to run the `spotless` formatter and `pre-commit` hooks automatically when you commit your code.

If you do not have `spotless` set up in your project, you can follow the instructions in the [Setting up Spotless](#-setting-up-spotless) section to set it up.

### üîß Installing the Git Hooks

Simply adding this `submodule` is not enough. We then need to install the scripts within this repository as proper `git hooks`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Hook Installation (Not Recommended)

You can manually install the hooks, as described in the [quickstart](#-quickstart) section, by running `./.hooks/install-hooks.sh` if on **Mac** or **Linux**, or `.\.hooks\install-hooks.ps1` if on **Windows**.

> **Note**: The above commands assume you are in the root of your project that has added this repository as a submodule, and that the submodule was added to the `.hooks` folder. If you are not, you will need to adjust the path to the `install-hooks.sh` or `install-hooks.ps1` script accordingly.

#### ü§ñ Automatic Maven Hook Installation

It should go without saying why a manual only means of hook installation is bad. Ideally, we have the hook installation enforced automatically for us by some sort of shared mechanism. Luckily, if you are reading this, then you are using `Gradle`, which is easy to configure arbitrary tasks to run at various points in the build lifecycle. This can be done by adding the following configuration to the `build.gradle`:

```groovy
tasks.register('installLocalGitHook', Copy) {
   from new File(rootProject.rootDir, '.hooks/pre-commit')
   into { new File(rootProject.rootDir, '.git/hooks') }
   filePermissions {
      user {
         read=true
         write=true
         execute=true
      }
      group {
         read=true
         write=true
         execute=true
      }
      other {
         read=true
         write=false
         execute=true
      }
   }

   from new File(rootProject.rootDir, '.hooks/post-commit')
   into { new File(rootProject.rootDir, '.git/hooks') }
   filePermissions {
      user {
         read=true
         write=true
         execute=true
      }
      group {
         read=true
         write=true
         execute=true
      }
      other {
         read=true
         write=false
         execute=true
      }
   }
}

build {
    dependsOn installGitHooks
}
```

## üß© What These Hooks Do

This repo provides Git `pre-commit` and `post-commit` hooks that automatically run `Spotless` on files you've changed. This ensures consistent formatting and reduces noisy diffs before commits ever hit GitHub for PR Review.

## ü™ù Included Hooks

- `pre-commit`: Applies `Spotless` to staged files before commit
- `post-commit`: Re-runs `Spotless` after commit to handle missed diffs

## üó∫Ô∏è Flow Chart

```pqsql
git commit
   ‚Üì
pre-commit hook
   ‚Üì
spotless:apply
   ‚Üì
conflict resolution
   ‚Üì
post-commit hook
   ‚Üì
spotless:apply
   ‚Üì
commit allowed or blocked (only blocked by `spotless` or pre-commit errors)
```

### üîÄ Conflict Resolution

These hooks are designed to stash non-committed changes prior to commit, so that when `spotless` is run, it can apply the formatting to only the files being changed. After un-stashing, if there are conflicts, we will resolve them, re-run `spotless`, and re-commit the changes. This is done to ensure that the commit is always in a clean state, and that `spotless` has been applied before committing.

### üß≠ Hook Behavior During Merge/Rebase

These hooks are merge-aware and won‚Äôt interfere with merge commits or rebases. Conflicting files are automatically resolved in favor of 'theirs' and re-staged after formatting.

## üßº Setting up Spotless

For more information on how to set up `spotless`, please refer to [SPOTLESS-CONFIG.md](./docs/SPOTLESS-CONFIG.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configuration information, such as how to automatically update the submodule with Maven, exclude submodule updates during CI, or a sample `README.md` change to make to your project, please refer to [ADVANCED-CONFIGURATION.md](./docs/ADVANCED-CONFIGURATION.md).
